# Coalition Selfbot

Probably renaming this repository soon, selfbot with a utility focus.

## Setup

First run this.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next create a file called `.env` and add your discord token to it in this format.

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YourTokenGoesHere
```

Finally run the script with

```py
python main.py
```
